# Finance Fundamentals in Python 🐍💰

This repository serves as a learning journal for the **Finance Fundamentals** skill track on DataCamp. It contains Python implementations of core financial concepts, investment analysis, and data-driven decision-making simulations.

The repository is structured by course modules, focusing on practical applications like mortgage simulators and budgeting tools.

## 📚 Curriculum & Progress

### 🏗️ Prerequisites
* **01 - Introduction to Python for Finance** (Completed/Skipped)
* **02 - Intermediate Python for Finance** (Completed/Skipped)

### 📈 03 - Introduction to Financial Concepts in Python
*Focus: Time value of money, project valuation, and personal financial planning.*

* **Chapter 1: The Time Value of Money (TVM)**
    * Calculated **Present Value (PV)** and **Future Value (FV)** using compound interest.
    * Analyzed discount factors and inflation adjustments.

* **Chapter 2: Making Data-Driven Financial Decisions**
    * Compared project proposals using **NPV (Net Present Value)** and **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**.
    * Calculated **WACC** (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) for corporate finance decisions.
    * Applied the **Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA)** method for projects with different lifespans.

* **Chapter 3: Project - Mortgage Simulator 🏠**
    * Built a comprehensive simulator for a home purchase in **Hoboken, NJ**.
    * Modeled amortization schedules (Principal vs. Interest).
    * Simulated economic scenarios like "Underwater Mortgages" (falling housing prices).
    * Forecasted cumulative payments and home equity ownership.

* **Chapter 4: Project - Budgeting Application 💼**
    * Designed a personal finance tool for a Data Scientist living in **San Francisco**.
    * Forecasted salary growth, tax rates, and cost of living.
    * **Net Worth Projection:** Simulated wealth accumulation and investment portfolio growth.
    * Implemented a "Millionaire Calculation" to determine required savings rates.

### 🔜 Upcoming Modules
